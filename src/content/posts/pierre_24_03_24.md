Building on the insights from our previous discussion in “Navigating the nexus: Cultural norms, family, and gender stereotypes in women's leadership” (https://medium.com/@hazeyouth2/navigating-the-nexus-cultural-norms-family-and-gender-stereotypes-in-womens-leadership-6dded03f6656), this third installment in our seven-part series turns the spotlight to the educational and professional development landscape for young women leaders. Drawing from a HAZEYouth 2024 survey, we find that 48% of young women pinpoint the lack of education, mentorship, and effective advocacy as critical barriers on their leadership journey.

This post explores how the absence of mentorship and supportive networks, alongside gaps in professional development and self-advocacy, intertwine to form significant hurdles. A striking 62.3% of young women feel the void of mentorship, underscoring the crucial need for a supportive community to nurture emerging leaders.

Furthermore, 27.3% of respondents call attention to the professional development and self-advocacy gaps, emphasizing the importance of skill-building programs that empower young women to take the lead in championing their careers. Meanwhile, 10.4% highlight educational limitations, pointing to the urgent need for accessible, quality education as the bedrock for aspiring leaders.

This blog explores the intertwined challenges of educational opportunities, mentorship availability, and the need for strong advocacy in young women's leadership. Each element serves as a cornerstone in building a foundation upon which young women can not only aspire to leadership roles but also excel in them. Educational opportunities equip young women with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary for leadership, while mentorship provides the guidance and support to navigate the professional landscape. Advocacy amplifies their voices, ensuring their capabilities are recognized and valued, thereby creating a synergistic framework that fosters young women's ascent to leadership.

#### Educational limitations to young women’s leadership
Only one out of ten young women (11%) identified education as a direct barrier to their leadership aspirations. This finding could suggest a positive trend towards narrowing gender disparities in education. However, it remains crucial to acknowledge that for this subset of young women, educational barriers still pose a significant obstacle to their leadership journey. From illiteracy and low education levels to the limited availability of formal education and a general state of ignorance, these obstacles severely limit young women's opportunities and effectiveness in leadership roles.

#### Manifestations and implications 
Low education levels serve as a foundational barrier, hindering young women from acquiring essential leadership skills like critical thinking and problem-solving. Furthermore, limited educational opportunities, shaped by socio-economic, geographical, or cultural factors, restrict access to diverse learning experiences. The divide between formal education and informal learning also poses a challenge, as the lack of recognition for non-traditional educational paths can impede progress in leadership careers. Illiteracy, or the inability to read and write, further limits access to crucial information and communication necessary for effective leadership. Additionally, ignorance, or a lack of awareness about rights, opportunities, or critical issues, can significantly hinder informed decision-making and leadership effectiveness.

#### Maya's path: Overcoming educational barriers to leadership
My name is Maya, and I am 32 years old. Tragedy struck my family just before I could complete my final high school examinations, as my parents were killed in an accident. In the aftermath, my aunt took my brother and me into her care. Despite my brother being younger and not in a critical academic year, my aunt chose to finance his education, enabling him to progress through to university level. As for me, facing the harsh reality of circumstances, I was forced to drop out of school.

Debating had always been my passion, and I led debating clubs throughout my school years. I harbored ambitions of becoming a member of parliament. This dream, however, was derailed by my inability to meet the educational qualifications required for candidacy, notably the advanced high school certificate.

Finding a new direction, I joined a women's nonprofit organization, where, despite my wealth of experience and innate capability, I often felt invisible, sidelined from meetings and decision-making. It was disheartening to see younger colleagues, newly graduated and less experienced, quickly ascend to program manager positions and use the organization as a launchpad for their careers in more prominent national and international NGOs.

Everything began to change four years ago when I decided to resume my education, completing my high school and enrolling in an evening degree program. As I pursued higher education, my colleagues' perceptions shifted; they began to value my input, seeking my advice and including me in decision-making processes. Today, I lead the national malaria program, a role that speaks volumes of the power of education, perseverance, and the will to overcome the odds stacked against us.

#### Strategies to address the barriers
The fact that education is no longer a predominant barrier for the majority does not diminish its importance for those who are still affected. Addressing educational barriers not only empowers young women to aspire to leadership roles but also equips them with the tools necessary to excel in them, fostering a more inclusive and equitable future for all.

To dismantle these barriers, a multifaceted approach is necessary:
1. Initiatives to increase access to both basic and higher education for young women are crucial. Scholarships, online learning platforms, and community education programs can play significant roles.

2. Recognizing and crediting informal learning and life experiences can broaden leadership opportunities for young women with self-taught skills.

3. Addressing illiteracy through targeted programs can open up new worlds for young women, enabling them to engage with written materials, apply for grants, and communicate their ideas effectively.

4. Campaigns and workshops designed to inform young women of their rights, opportunities, and the importance of education in leadership can empower them to take active steps toward their goals.

#### Absence of mentorship and networks to support young women’s leadership
A significant 62% of the survey participants identified the lack of mentors, role models, and support networks as a crucial barrier for young women in leadership. Mentors and role models play a critical role in guiding young women, offering advice, and serving as examples of successful leadership. Without such figures, young women may struggle with finding direction and motivation, essential components for developing leadership capabilities and self-assurance.

Furthermore, when established leaders monopolize spaces without nurturing new talent, it significantly exacerbates the problem, effectively stifling the growth and development of emerging young leaders. This practice not only hinders the fresh perspectives and innovative ideas that young leaders can bring to the table but also contributes to a cycle of exclusion that can be challenging to break, further entrenching the barriers to leadership diversity and inclusivity.

Equally important are the support networks that foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual advocacy among peers. These networks empower young women to assert their presence, champion their own causes, and unlock opportunities that might otherwise remain out of reach. Yet, when these support structures are missing, young women's voices can be diminished, their visibility reduced, and their potential for leadership development constrained

#### Emma's story: Fostering new generations in women's leadership
My name is Emma, a recent graduate. Before starting university, I had the chance to train at a young women's leadership academy, which ignited my passion for feminism and movement building. As part of my training, I crafted an action plan outlining my leadership journey and ambitions, ambitiously titled "Take on and over the world." I joined several women's civil society organizations, where the membership was primarily older, and we, the younger members, struggled to find opportunities to share our perspectives. This was disheartening.

During one meeting, a fellow younger member highlighted a concerning trend: the lack of new faces in elective positions, especially those designated for women through affirmative action. Despite being empowered to compete alongside men for mainstream positions, these older women continued to cling to the affirmative action slots, failing to foster young leadership—a disappointing example for us. This discouraged me from seeking mentorship within these groups, fearing their reluctance to nurture the next generation.

In response, a few of us mobilized other young women to establish a nonprofit focused on encouraging young women's participation in public decision-making. Our organization is youth-led, adhering to a principle that board members and staff should be predominantly young. However, we recognize the value of intergenerational connections and welcome the involvement of experienced women leaders, creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for emerging young leaders.

#### Strategies for overcoming barriers

To cultivate an environment where young women are supported in their aspirations towards leadership and empowered to excel and contribute significantly to their domains, a collective approach is needed:

1. Initiate formal mentorship schemes within organizations and across sectors, pairing young women with seasoned leaders for knowledge sharing and guidance.
2. Motivate established women leaders to commit to developing emerging talent, thus disrupting the cycle of exclusive leadership spaces.
3. Create and promote platforms and forums where young women can articulate their ideas, exchange experiences, and forge connections with potential mentors and allies.
4. Champion organizational cultures that embrace diversity and inclusion, recognizing the value of diverse perspectives and experiences in nurturing innovative leadership.
5. Promote digital professional networks by fostering a community of industry peers, offering a platform that facilitates visibility, and encouraging the exchange of ideas and expertise.

#### Gaps in professional development and self-advocacy
The journey to leadership for young women is often obstructed by gaps in professional development and opportunities for self-advocacy. The limited availability of career growth training and inadequacy in leadership knowledge, coupled with insufficient exposure to diverse experiences, restrict their capacity to develop the skills essential for effective leadership. Furthermore, the absence of foundational networking opportunities limits their ability to connect with peers, potential mentors, and other leaders in their field.

The challenge of self-advocacy is particularly pronounced. An inability or hesitation to assert oneself can deter young women from pursuing opportunities, negotiating for enhanced roles, or expressing their ideas and convictions with confidence. This is frequently exacerbated by societal norms and gender stereotypes that may dissuade women from being assertive or promoting their achievements.

#### Zoe's path to self-advocacy
I am Zoe, and my aspiration has always been to excel in the tech industry, a sector notoriously challenging for women. Early in my career, I actively sought professional development opportunities to enhance my skills. I was not successful. Workplace opportunities often favored men or more senior employees, and leadership programs seemed tailored for those with traditional career trajectories in leadership.

I turned to my mother for advice, a seasoned leader herself. She asked me about my vision, which, admittedly, was somewhat vague at the time. Together, we crafted a vision board, laying out clear actions to reach my goals. This process included an "awareness check" to identify my strengths and weaknesses, understand my needs, and recognize my rights.

This journey taught me effective communication and the importance of being assertive. Feeling empowered, I approached our human resources director to highlight that despite my eligibility for annual on-the-job training, I had been consistently overlooked. His initial response was less than encouraging, but my persistence paid off. I remember his words clearly: "These empowered women, they are too assertive... they do not give up until they get what they want." His remark is a testament to the effectiveness of self-advocacy.

I urge all young women to embrace and practice self-advocacy. It is a powerful tool that enables you to take charge of your life, ensuring your needs are met and your rights upheld.

#### Strategies to bridge the gap
To pave the way for a new generation of women leaders, equipped with the education, support, and skills they need to succeed, we need to tackle these barriers head-on:

1. Enhance access to education and professional development opportunities for young women. This includes not only formal education but also specialized leadership training and skill-building programs.
2. Establish and strengthen mentorship networks to provide young women with the guidance, support, and inspiration they need. 
3. Empower young women to advocate for themselves and their leadership capabilities is also vital. This can be achieved through training programs focused on self-advocacy, negotiation skills, and personal branding.

#### The bottom line
In closing, the journey to leadership for young women is paved with numerous challenges, from navigating the complexities of education and professional development to finding one's voice through self-advocacy. However, the stories of Maya, Emma, and Zoe remind us that these obstacles, while formidable, are not insurmountable. Through perseverance, self-awareness, and the support of mentors and networks, young women can break through these barriers to emerge as empowered leaders.

Their experiences underscore the importance of creating inclusive environments that recognize and value the contributions of young women. By addressing educational limitations, fostering mentorship and supportive networks, and encouraging self-advocacy, we can cultivate a generation of women leaders poised to take on the world. Let us commit to this change, for in empowering young women, we enrich the tapestry of leadership with diverse voices and perspectives, driving innovation and progress for all.
