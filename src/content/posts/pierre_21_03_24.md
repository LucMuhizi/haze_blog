### Understanding barriers to young women’s leadership
In today's world, young women are increasingly stepping up to lead, breaking through glass ceilings and challenging the status quo. Yet, despite significant progress, a myriad of barriers continue to hinder their leadership journey. This series, "Breaking barriers empowering young women leaders," aims to shed light on these obstacles, drawing from a survey conducted by HAZEYouth that engaged 203 young women aged 18-35. Participants were asked to identify the key challenges they face in leadership, offering valuable insights into the hurdles that need to be dismantled.

##### Discrimination and bias: 
At the forefront, a staggering 94% of respondents highlighted discrimination and bias as significant barriers. These challenges stem from deep-seated societal attitudes, organizational cultures, and systemic inequalities, impacting young women's access to leadership roles and their effectiveness as leaders.

##### Gender stereotypes and cultural norms: 
Further compounding the issue, 62% of the young women pointed to gender stereotypes, cultural norms, and family dynamics as critical obstacles. These ingrained societal beliefs and attitudes impose restrictive and often discriminatory expectations on young women's capabilities and opportunities.

##### Sexual misconduct: 
Alarmingly, 60% reported sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment as barriers. These unwelcome behaviors range from verbal harassment and objectification to physical abuse and sexual assault, often perpetrated by those in power.

##### Financial obstacles: 
Financial constraints were identified by 58% of the survey participants as a significant hurdle. These obstacles encompass a broad range of financial challenges that impede young women's access to education, professional development, and leadership opportunities.

##### Educational and professional development gaps: 
Lastly, 48% highlighted gaps in education, mentorship, and advocacy as barriers. These areas are crucial for the development and support of young women in leadership roles.
